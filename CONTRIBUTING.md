# Contributing

1.  Fork the project and clone your fork.

2.  Create a local feature branch:

        $ git checkout -b <branch>

3.  Make one or more atomic commits. Do not commit changes to
    __dist/*__.

4.  Run `npm test` and address any errors. It will install
    needed dependencies locally.  Preferably, fix commits in place using `git
    rebase` or `git commit --amend` to make the changes easier to review and to
    keep the history tidy.

5.  Push to your fork:

        $ git push origin <branch>

6.  Open a pull request.
